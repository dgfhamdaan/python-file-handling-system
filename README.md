# 🗂️ Python File Handling System

A simple **command-line based File Handling System** developed using Python.
This project demonstrates **CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** on files using Python’s built-in libraries.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Python File Handling System allows users to manage files directly from the terminal.
It provides basic file operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting files while handling errors gracefully.

This project is ideal for **beginners learning Python file handling concepts**.

## 🚀 Features

* 📄 List all files and folders in the current directory
* ➕ Create a new file and write content
* 📖 Read content from an existing file
* ✏️ Update file:

  * Rename a file
  * Overwrite file content
  * Append new content
* ❌ Delete files safely
* ⚠️ Exception handling using `try-except`

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* `pathlib` module for file and directory handling
* `os` module for file deletion
